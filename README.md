# Radiogenomics-ccRCC-Tstage

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the pathological T stage of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) based on radiogenomic models utilizing tumor and perirenal fat imaging data. By integrating imaging data with genomic information, we provide more accurate predictions for pathological staging.

## Features
- Development of radiogenomic models
- Prediction of pathological T stage
- Visualization tools for analysis

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RadGen-ccRCC-Tstage.git
